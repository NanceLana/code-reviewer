1. The LLM wouldn't recognize indentations for Python snippets as input and it kept flagging it as buggy even though it was alright. So, I created a fix that might not be that efficient (convert_to_symbol_indentation(code_content: str)). If I had more time, I would get to the root of the issue and fine-tune the model if needed. 

2. I would like the LLM to return improved code snippets and later insert them into the user's code wherever needed. 

3. I would make this dynamic if we have a high-enough budget. If the LLM senses an error, if it senses a very long snippet that could be otherwise swapped with a smaller piece of code, it immediately recommends the remedy.

4. Lastly, I would like to make this tool easily integrable with existing code editor (Also to help improvement number 3)
